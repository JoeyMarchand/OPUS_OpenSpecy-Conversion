# OPUS_OpenSpecy-Conversion-
Micro-FTIR Spectral data from BRUKER LUMOS II with 32 x 32 FPA detector. Indiviudal spectra are preprocessed (Baseline Correction, and Normalized to max intensity 1.000) before being analyzed through open source polymer identification OpenSPecy. 
This is a preliminary code that is subjected to change. Feel free to email at March322@d.umn.edu for further quesitons.
